# Geometric Algebra Transformers for Vessel Classification

This project is an unofficial implementation of [[1]](#1). The goal of this project is to solve a simple binary classification task, based on a dataset of meshes of two types of arteries: single and bifurcating. The base architecture is a transformer. We compare the approach leveraging on geometric algebra with a baseline.

## Execution
You can execute the code [here](main.ipynb)
