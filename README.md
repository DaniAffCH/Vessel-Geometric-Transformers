# Geometric Algebra Transformers for Vessel Classification

This project is an unofficial implementation of [[1]](#1). The goal of this project is to solve a simple binary classification task, based on a dataset of meshes of two types of arteries: single and bifurcating. The base architecture is a transformer. We compare the approach leveraging on geometric algebra with a baseline.

## Dataset

There are five features for each sample:
- Wall shear stress
- Pressure
- Position
- Face
- Inlet index (positions where inlets to arteries are located)

## Embedding of data: Geometric Algebra

## Operations in E(3): Equivariant layers
